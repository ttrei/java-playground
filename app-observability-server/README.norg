  Started here: https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot
  It linked to https://start.spring.io/
  Settings:
  - Project: "Gradle - Groovy"
  - Language: Java

  Copied prometheus+grafana docker config from
  https://github.com/marcingrzejszczak/observability-boot-blog-post.
  Removed loki and tempo from the config.
